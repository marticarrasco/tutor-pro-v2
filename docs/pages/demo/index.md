# Demo Dashboard (`/demo`)

## Overview
The demo dashboard mirrors the authenticated home experience but operates entirely on in-memory demo context data so visitors can explore the workflow without creating an account.

## Session logging
- Reuses the session logging form with controlled inputs for student, date, and duration.
- Validates required fields before calling `addSession` from the demo context.
- Calculates end time and total amount based on the selected student’s hourly rate, then appends the mock session with default metadata (subject, payment status, notes).
- Resets the form and emits toast notifications on success or validation failure.

## Dashboard insights
- Summarises demo metrics including today’s session count, earnings for the current week, total students, pending payments, and recent sessions.
- Presents dedicated cards for quick stats, a list of pending payments with totals, and a recent sessions feed showing payment status pills.

## Layout & feedback
- Uses `<DemoSidebar />` for navigation and `<PageHeader />` with a friendly greeting.
- Includes a shared `<Toaster />` to surface notifications generated by interactions.
